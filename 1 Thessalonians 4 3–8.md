3 It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; 

4 that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable, 

5 not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God; 

6 and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister. The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins, as we told you and warned you before. 

7 For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life. 

8 Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being but God, the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit.
