But now thus says the LORD, 
he who created you, O Jacob, 
he who formed you, O Israel: 
**â€œFear not, for I have redeemed you; 
I have called you by name, you are mine.** 

2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; 
and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; 
when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, 
and the flame shall not consume you. 

3 For I am the LORD your God, 
the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. 
I give Egypt as your ransom, 
Cush and Seba in exchange for you.
