5 If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you to some extent—not to put it too severely. 
6 The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient. 
7 Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. 
8 I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him. 
9 Another reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything. 
10 Anyone you forgive, I also forgive. And what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, 
11 in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.
