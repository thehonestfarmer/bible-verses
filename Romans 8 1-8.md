### Life Through the Spirit

8 Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, 2 because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A1-8&version=NIV#fen-NIV-28119a "See footnote a")] free from the law of sin and death. 3 For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh,[[b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A1-8&version=NIV#fen-NIV-28120b "See footnote b")] God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering.[[c](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A1-8&version=NIV#fen-NIV-28120c "See footnote c")] And so he condemned sin in the flesh, 4 in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

5 Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. 6 The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace. 7 The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so. 8 Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.
