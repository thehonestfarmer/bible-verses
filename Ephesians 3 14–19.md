14 For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, 
15 from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, 
16 that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, 

17 so that **Christ may dwell in your hearts through faithâ€”that you, being rooted and grounded in love,** 
18 **may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,** 
19 **and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge,** that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
